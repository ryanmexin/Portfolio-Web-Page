    <h2> About Ryan </h2>
    
    <p>I graduated from Illinois state university with a degree in business administration in 2019. Over the past two years I began to realize my passion for web development and how much I enjoy it. I recently became a student at Thinkful to begin my journey to become a software engineer.</p> 

    <p>With my passion for sports and the team aspect involved I think it would be great to work with others and build new applications and websites.<p/>

   <p>In my free time I enjoy watching baseball and football and pretty much anything outdoors as well as playing video games on my PC. I have created a list below to help.</p>
   <! Unordered list to describe my favorite activities >
   <ul>
   <li> Baseball</li>
   <li> Football</li>
   <li> Anything Outside</li>
   </ul>
